# Tableau-Color-XML
Very simple script that generates the XML output to add into Tableau's config file for new color schemas.

Edit the script hex_list to add your colors to the hex_list. Run the script and copy the output (from .xml file or console log) into the Tableau config.

To add this color schema to Tableau you can follow [this guide](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/formatting_create_custom_colors.htm).
